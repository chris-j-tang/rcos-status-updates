After introductions were made in the OSCP, I noticed multiple students who seemed both knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the OSCP.
I talked to two of them about mentoring for this semester, as this particular RCOS project has lots of new participants,
with only 1 mentor covering.

I was able to convince one to switch over to mentoring, giving them a brief runthrough of the additional responsibilities in
addition to working on the project.

This week, I hope to establish some groundwork to accustom the students to the idea of status updates, how to use Git, and help
Milena work with Mitchell in mentoring for the small group.
