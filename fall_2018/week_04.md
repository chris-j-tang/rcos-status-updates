## Last Week's Accomplishments
None of the regular coordinators were available to talk last Friday, so last Friday I led large group for the first time.
Doing so really tested my mettle -- there were technical difficulties, as the projector kept on turning on and off, the 
speaker listed on the slides was for the coming week instead of this week's large group, having presenters who were clearly not 
prepared, having presenters not available, and accommodating impromptu presentations by RCOS alumni.

We went over time by about 15 minutes, which was discussed in the mentor meeting that came this Sunday. Mentors were concerned
with the timing of speakers, and relevance of guest/projects when it came to the RCOS large group. Time cards of some sort 
will need to be crafted.

## This Week's Plan
Our biggest problems lie in scaling RCOS while preserving the open-source 'anarchy' that RCOS grew up in. We will be meeting 
with a member of OSI on Thursday to discuss resources and how we can be more active in the OSI community.

## Anything Blocking?
Having trouble scaling RCOS -- major reworks needed over the next few semesters.

## Notess
