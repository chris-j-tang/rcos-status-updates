Last Week's Accomplishments
  We hosted a last minute coordinator's meeting over the last few weeks, along with mentor meetings. During these, we discussed the possibility of having RCOS implement the same mentor training that all other CS mentors undergo, in lieu of training that the Archer center has offered. We have also discussed the inability to implement the Code of Conduct in RCOS, and per Sid's suggestion, are considering re-linking or using the official RPI 'code of conduct'. Offenses in regards to this will have actual consequences, followed through by the RPI administration.
  

This Week's Plan
  This Friday, the coordinators will have a meeting to discuss how to proceed with coordinator interviewing, and final grades. We will additionally look at how to best restructure large group meetings, a hotly debated topic.
  Half of the OSCP small group (~8 people) will be presenting this Friday. I will be giving feedback today, in regards to their test run during small group today.

Anything Blocking?
