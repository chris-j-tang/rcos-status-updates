When I arrived at RCOS (a little later), Ethan was already starting to run through the hour long presentation he had put together 
in regards to the foundation of the OSCP he envisioned. It seems that the coding&&community club decided to make an open
source offshoot of their work to gather more heads to work on their cause, with OSCP being the result so there 
was already a lot of underlying structure in regards to what had previously  been done, and what would like to be done.

After his presentation, Aidan and I talked to Ethan about becoming a mentor as he already runs the meetings (preparing 
his own slides beforehand), smaller group meetings for all of the area specific groups he and coding&&community 
have put together. He agreed to do so, effectively upping this small group's mentor count to 3. After Mitchell alerted me
to the fact that the midterm RCOS evaluation form was still Spring 2018, I changed it to Fall 2018. We also had a mentor 
meeting last Sunday, of which we covered a lot of ground in regards to nullifying the committees and replacing it with 
an open queue of problems, and how to best manage talking time in regards to speakers.

This week, I'm planning on starting to check in periodically with other projects in other small groups.
