## Last Week's Accomplishments

We had one of our first work sessions this Sunday in AE 119, instead of on Wednesdays. There was a decent showing, perhaps
also because of the coffee and donuts we had procured. I talked with several members in regards to presentating at RCOS,
and helped them with their projects.

Last week, I also met with multiple members of the small group to go over their commits and status update histories 
to give them a general overview of their current grade in the class. I also gave a lot of career advice and 
course advice to members in the class (as it was registration season).

## This Week's Plan

Since the OSCP is a large small group (the irony), the group is splitting into two separate presentations.
I will be reviewing their presentations during small group over the next week (and maybe over the break) to help them prepare.
 
We are also attempting to coordinate with Nick for a talk this semester. However, looking at the schedule so far,
I am not sure how feasible having him come in to present will be.

## Anything Blocking?

N/A.
